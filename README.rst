The PennyLane-Perceval plugin integrates the Quandela Perceval quantum computing framework with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`Perceval <https://perceval.quandela.net/docs/index.html/>`_ provides tools for composing photonic circuits from linear optical components like beamsplitters and phase shifters, defining single-photon sources, manipulating Fock states, and running simulations.
